## Welcome to the Crypto Recommendation
### Crypto Recommendation helps invest their salaries on cryptos 

In the CRYPTO_NAME_values.csv (e.g. BTC_values.csv) you can find one monthâ€™s prices for one crypto in USD.
All files are located in the src/main/resources/data/ directory. Initially the cryptos are only six, but when new files with prices are added to the resources/data/ directory, 
they will be included.
